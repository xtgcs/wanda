            </div>
            <p>We are a global sports events, media and marketing platform with significant intellectual property
               rights, long-term relationships and broad execution capabilities through which we create value for
               stakeholders in all parts of the sports ecosystem, from rights owners, to brands and advertisers, and to
               fans and athletes. We own, or otherwise have contractual rights to, an extensive portfolio of global,
               regional and national sports properties from which we seek to generate revenue across the value chain,
               including events operation, media production and media distribution, sponsorship and marketing, digital
               solutions and ancillary services. </p>
            <p>
               We have combined the strengths of our Infront, The IRONMAN Group and Wanda Sports businesses to form one
               of the world's largest sports events, media and marketing platforms.
               We have a global sports event portfolio built principally around the strength of globally recognized
               brands and related intellectual property in mass participation sports owned by The IRONMAN Group,
               including triathlon, running and mountain biking, which we complement with personal and corporate fitness
               and other events, such as obstacle course racing, owned by Infront, which benefit from its relationships
               with brands and other stakeholders. We seek to create inspirational sports experiences for athletes and
               establish highly engaged and dedicated communities for athletes. We believe that, through our in-depth
               knowledge of mass participation sports, our global insights into athletes and our technical capabilities,
               we are well-placed to deliver engaging mass participation sports events to our athletes, partners, and
               fans worldwide. In addition, we are able to develop unique insights from the wealth of data generated
               from our athletes enabling us to amplify athlete engagement and retention, increase effectiveness of
               sponsorship arrangements and otherwise maximize the income potential for sports events, including through
               targeted services and cross-selling opportunities.

               with brands and other stakeholders. We seek to create inspirational sports experiences for athletes and
               establish highly engaged and dedicated communities for athletes. We believe that, through our in-depth
               knowledge of mass participation sports, our global insights into athletes and our technical capabilities,
               we are well-placed to deliver engaging mass participation sports events to our athletes, partners, and

          <p>
             BEIJING, March 17, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Wanda Sports Group Company Limited (NASDAQ: WSG) (the
             “Company”) today announced that the Company signed a $240 million senior term loan facility agreement
