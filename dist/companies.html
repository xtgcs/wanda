             New facility increases the Company’s liquidity and reduces fiancing costs
          </div>
          <p>
             BEIJING, March 17, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Wanda Sports Group Company Limited (NASDAQ: WSG) (the
             “Company”) today announced that the Company signed a $240 million senior term loan facility agreement
             with Credit Suisse AG, Singapore Branch, enabling the Company to refinance and prepay its existing senior
             364-day term loan facility, dated March 15, 2019.
          </p>
          <p>
             Mr. Hengming Yang, President and CEO of Wanda Sports Group said, “We are very pleased with the new credit
             facility. The successful refinancing demonstrates continued confidence in our business and operations,
             despite the global challenges and uncertainties resulting from COVID-19. We will continue to work
             diligently on behalf of our partners, athletes, fans and shareholders.”
          </p>

          <p>
             Mr. Brian Liao, Global CFO of Wanda Sports Group said, “As always, we are committed to lowering our
             costs, monitoring our use of cash, and balancing our investments with disciplined management of our
             existing financial resources to optimize shareholder returns. The new facility provides the Company with
             additional financial flexibility, while allowing it to take advantage of the current favorable interest
             rate environment to lower interest costs.”

          </p>
          <p>
             The term of the new facility is 364 days. The pricing will initially be LIBOR plus an applicable margin,
             and the term is subject to certain mandatory prepayment terms. These and the other principal terms of the
             new facility are outlined further in a Form 6-K (Report of Foreign Private Issuer) submitted today to the
             U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

          </p>
